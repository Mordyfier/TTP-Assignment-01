                 <h3>Vegetables are important for health reasons</h3>
                 <p>Eating vegetables provides your body with crucial nutrients - vitamins and minerals that you need.
                    Brocolli has lots of iron which gives the body more strength. Carrots have lots of vitamin A, which is 
                    very helpful for keeping our eyes strong. Brussel sprouts have lots of potassium which is crucial in the 
                    functioning of the body's muscles and nerves.

                 <h3>If you don't eat veggies, bad things can happen</h3>
                 <p>Because vegetables provide so many of the nutriets that our bodies need to function, lack of vegetable intake
                     can cause some serious issues. It can cause lethargy and fatigue. Low vegetable intake is correlated with heart diseases.
                     Not eating your veggies results in mineral and vitamin deficiencies which can lead to diseases such as scurvy,
                     digestive issues, vision loss, and depression. So be sure to take care of your health and eat vegetables.

                 <h3>Veggies are helpful when trying to maintain a healthy diet</h3>
                 <p>If you choose vegetables instead of less healthy options, it can lead to a healthier lifestyle.
                     Everyone needs to eat to remain healthy, and that includes foods from all the food groups. But when 
                     it comes to extra snacking, eating extra sugary or high carb foods can lead to health issues. Choosing veggies
                     as an alternative snack is a much better option. This way, if you like to eat, you can snack on as many veggies 
                     as you wish without it having negative health impacts.
